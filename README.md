Roommate Expense Tracker
============
The goal of this application is to satisfy the requirements for Project 2 in a fun way that is also useful. Using this application, you will be able to register an apartment, add roommates, view your monthly expenses, add new one time or recurring expenses, mark them as paid, and see a tally of how much you owe each of your roommates.

Requirements
My project does slightly deviate from the requirements of P2. Firstly, I asked if I could deviate from the framework (Piazza CID 194). I also asked if I could deviate from the microblog type site in favor for something a little more original but has similar core components (Piazza CID 288). Below I have listed the feature requirements and how they coorespond to this application.

- Sign up
- Log in
- Log out
- Add posts (Expenses)
- See a list of all other users (Roommates)
- Follow and unfollow other users (Linking your account to an Apartment)
- View a stream of posts from the users they follow (Browse Expenses)
+1 other feature of your choosing - (Add and browse Payments)
+1 other feature of your choosing - (Calculate a Balance based on Expenses, Payments, and the # of roommates tied to your Apartment)

Todo
- Fix register with short password, lack of error
- Split navigation into Expenses, Payments
- Make home page have better stats
